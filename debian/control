Description: GPU accelerated radio interferometric calibration
 SAGECal is a very fast, memory efficient and GPU accelerated radio
 interferometric calibration program. It can handle all source models including
 points, Gaussians and Shapelets. It can calibrate along hundreds of directions
 without running out of memory in almost real time. Intel Xeon Phi acceleration
 is also available.
